# Flayme
flayme is an intelligent flight planning system (IFPS) <br />
modeled in anylogic using genetic algorithm for optimizing the system <br />
because github doesnt let us to upload large file I broke the giscache.p file <br />
in limited size part by this command : split --bytes=20M giscache.p new <br />
after you downloaded files for getting giscache.p back <br />
run this command : cat newa_* > giscache.p <br />

for running install anylogic from https://www.anylogic.com/ <br />
connect to internet open the .alp file from anylogic app and run the model <br />
you will see this environment below: <br />
